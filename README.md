For this mini-project, I am going to deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it again for the learnig purposes;
using the google-homepage to demostrate my skills about the web desining at the end of the project.

By the end of this projrct, I will be able to do the following:

1)Create a new repo for this project on GitHub.com
2)Then move that repository onto My local machine
3)Deconstruct an existing web page
4)And rebuild it again based on my understanding.
